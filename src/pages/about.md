Pathogen-agnostic clinical surveillance can improve biosecurity through the detection of novel, emerging and unexpected infection threats. Whilst there are numerous examples of pathogen detection and, to a lesser extent, discovery using pathogen-agnostic techniques such as metagenomic sequencing, at present there is no systematic surveillance based on this approach. In this protocol we link the network of clinical and research laboratories already undertaking pathogen-agnostic diagnostics on respiratory and imported fever samples into a single pilot for pathogen-agnostic surveillance.
